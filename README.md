## Introduction

These days as you can see that Chatbots are in high trend when it comes to Artificial Intelligence. As most of the organizations have already started implementing chatbots on their sites especially on e-commerce websites. 
To build a chatbot using NLP/Deep Learning takes a lot of time to build a chatbot easily but the only problem is that you need to feed as many data as you can for the bot to learn and here data doesn't just mean the questions and its category but also the question pattern.

## Chatbot Dataset Details

I tried to find the simple datasets for a chat bot (seq2seq). Then I decided to compose it myself. It is based on a website with simple dialogues for beginners.
First column is questions, second is answers.
